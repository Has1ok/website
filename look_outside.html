            sound sculpture <br>
            <br>
            How far does the inner voice travel to become sound? At what speed do thoughts shoot into the tunnels leading to the larynx? Where and when does affect get encoded into speech and sound? Reflecting and distorting impulses, the voice crawls out, while thoughts and affects are rushing by with the speed of an electromagnetic wave. <br>
            <br>
            The voice is our portal connecting the inner with the outer. The voice wanders around what has immediate reality inside the speaker, trying to draw the phenomenon into a verbal and sound range, but how much does it distort and stumble upon the impossibility of this connection. <br>
            <br>
            In the process of creating the work, an attempt was made to record automatic speech on a dictaphone, to synchronize the emergence of the inner and outer voices, to catch verbal and mental automatisms, word sequences that describe some kind of subjective reality. The recorded voice was passed through 2 stages of encoding-decoding (text recognition from voice recording and voice synthesis from text). The new text, spoken in a synthesized voice, creates even more distortion, but in this place a chance encounter with the unpronounceable gets materialized. <br>
            <br>
            The sound sculpture is assembled from chimneys, inside of which light and sound sources are placed. The shape of the pipe and its reflective surface refract light and sound. I endow the sculpture with my voice, layered and sometimes hidden behind synthesized voices. Due to errors and inaccuracies of text recognition from the recording, the voice of the automaton, confident, rushing at a given speed, stumbles, acquires some properties of my voice, that is uncertain and muffled. At the same time, the synthesized voice makes obvious how the emergence of thoughts and affects has an automatic quality to it. <br>
